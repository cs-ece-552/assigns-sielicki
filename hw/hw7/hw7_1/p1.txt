// Write your answer to Problem 1 (b) here

The assembly files are thoroughly commented and give a better overall
explanation with context. Please see those files for an overview.

==== Test 1 ====

Simply two subsequent add operations, where the operand could either
be improperly read from the register file or could be forwarded from
the prior instruction.

==== Test 2 ====

Sets up some memory, loads a value, nops to allow memory to complete,
and then adds with it. The source operand could either come from the
register file or could be forwarded.

==== Test 3 ====

Combination of both prior tests --- does a memory load, does an ALU
operation with the same register, then adds with the same
register. Effectively Checks that your priority mux ports are correct.
